This means every piece of data (value) is connected to a unique label (key).\n","- You use the key to get the value, just like using a name to find a phone number in a phonebook. Keys must be unique and are usually words or numbers, while values can be any type of data—like numbers, text, lists, or even other dictionaries.\n","- key will be  immutuable while we can change the value in it.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"3dF5Wjua0UZQ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#example of dictionary\n","dictionary1={\"bharat\":\"jodhpur\",\"america\":\"new york\"}\n","              #key      #value    #key      #value"],"metadata":{"id":"xo_Ai2Sdz1aV"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["question 5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n","- the main reason why someone will use set instead of list in python is when you want to ensure that your collection only contains unique items.\n","- Unlike lists, which allow duplicates, a set will automatically remove any repeated values. Sets are also faster for checking membership  compared to lists.\n","- This makes sets ideal when you need to handle large collections of data where speed and uniqueness are important.\n","\n","question 6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n","- string is an data type which only contains text only characters like name, other characters etc\n","## difference between string and list##\n","- string is immutuable while lists are mutuable.\n","- string is used when only text based data will be used while list involves all type of data.\n","- we can only use limited operations inn string like (+) and (*) while in list we can use .reduce ,.pop,add functions.\n","\n","\n","question 7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n","- Tuples ensure data integrity in Python because they are immutable. Once a tuple is created, its data cannot be changed, added to, or removed.\n","- This immutability makes sure the data stays consistent and safe from accidental changes, providing a reliable way to store important information.\n","- Since tuples can’t be modified, they help maintain the integrity of the data throughout the program.\n","\n","question 8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n","- hash table is a data strcture that stores the keys and value pair and it helps in accessing the keys or values by  converting the keys into index for us to modify it like adding values, removing it etc.\n","- In Python, the dictionary is built using a hash table. So when you create a dictionary, Python is using a hash table behind the scenes to store and look up your data fast.\n","\n","\n","qustion 9.Can lists contain different data types in Python ?\n","- yes list can contain different data types meaning they can store elements of different data types within the same list. that makes python list very popular among the coding industry itt can contain intiger,float,boen,complex like 1t+8 etc.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"iNww72Jr4TiS"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#example of list\n","list1=[1,2,3,4,5,True,False,\"narendra\"]"],"metadata":{"id":"it3gEOjZ34Yb"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["question 10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n","- Strings are immutable in Python, which means once you create a string, you can’t change it. You can’t change individual characters or modify the string directly.\n","- This is done for reasons like security, performance, and reliability. Since strings are used so often (like for keys, messages, and IDs), making them immutable helps prevent bugs and unwanted changes and prevents it from mis guiding.\n","-  If you try to change a string, Python will actually create a new string instead of changing the original.\n","\n","question 11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n","- Easy to update values using the key.\n","- Can store different types of values under meaningful keys.\n","-  Great for counting or grouping items.\n","-  Avoids duplicate keys — each key is unique.\n","- Supports quick deletion of items by key.\n","- allows for flexible data types as keys.\n","- Easy to merge with other dictionaries using methods like.\n","\n","question 12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list?\n","- You would use a tuple instead of a list when you want to store data that should not change.\n","- For example, if you’re storing the personal id information or bank account information , using a tuple is better because those values should stay the same. Since tuples are immutable, they help protect the data from being accidentally changed, making them ideal for fixed data that needs to stay consistent throughout the program.\n","\n","question 13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n","- python sets automaticlly removes the duplicate data.\n","- When you create a set, if there are any repeated items, only one copy of each unique value is kept.\n","- This means sets always contain only unique elements.

Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary?\n","- When you access an item in a dictionary (like my_dict[key]), Python quickly finds the value you want using a special trick called hashing.\n","\n","- Hashing is like turning the key into a unique number that tells Python exactly where to look for the value. like 0,1,2\n","\n","- Because of this trick, Python can find the value immediately without having to check every item in the dictionary.\n","\n","question 18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n","\n","- Use a list when you need an ordered collection of items or access by index.\n","- Use a list when you have simple, homogeneous data and don’t need key-value pairs.\n","- Use a dictionary when you need fast lookups by unique key and key-value pair associations.\n","- Use a list when you need to perform operations like slicing or iterating over a sequence of items.\n","- Use a list when the collection is small and performance isn’t a major concern.\n","\n","\n","question 19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n","- Dictionaries in Python are considered unordered because they do not maintain the order of the keys based on their insertion sequence (at least, not in the way a list or tuple would). This is a key distinction that comes from the way dictionaries are implemented internally.\n","\n","### Why are dictionaries unordered?\n","Dictionaries in Python are implemented using a **hash table**. Here’s a simple breakdown of how this works:\n","\n","1. **Hashing**: When you add a key-value pair to a dictionary, the key is passed through a hashing function that computes an index (or hash) in the underlying array.\n","   \n","2. **No guaranteed order**: The hash table doesn’t inherently track the order of insertion. It just places each key-value pair at a specific index based on the hash of the key,\n","\n","3. **Efficiency**: The primary advantage of using a hash table (and why dictionaries are implemented this way) is speed. Lookups, inserts, and deletions are typically done in constant time, O(1), which is very efficient.\n","\n","### Does this affect data retrieval?\n","While dictionaries are unordered, this doesn’t affect the ability to retrieve data **by key**. You can still access any value in a dictionary by referencing its key, and the retrieval will be fast (O(1) on average).\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","question 20.
