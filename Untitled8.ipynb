It is a real, usable version of the blueprint (class) that holds actual data and can perform actions.\n","\n","#question-4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n","- Abstraction\n","  - Hides the details and shows only the important stuff.\n","\n","- Encapsulation\n","  - Hides the data and protects it from being changed directly.\n","\n","#question-5.What are dunder methods in Python?\n","- Dunder methods in Python (short for \"double underscore\" methods) are special built-in methods that start and end with double underscores, like __init__, __str__, __len__, etc.\n","\n","- They are also called magic methods because Python automatically calls them for certain operations.\n","\n","#question-6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n","- Inheritance means one class gets properties and methods from another class. It's like a child inheriting features from a parent.\n","\n","#question-7.What is polymorphism in OOP?\n","- Polymorphism means \"many forms\". It lets you use the same method name for different objects, and the method can do different things depending on the object.\n","\n","#question-8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n","- Encapsulation in Python is about protecting the data (attributes) of a class and restricting access to it directly. Instead, you control how data is accessed or modified through methods (functions).\n","  - it is achived by 2 methods:-\n","    - private method -You make variables private by prefixing them with __ (double underscore), making it harder to access them directly from outside the class.\n","    - Public Methods- You create getter and setter methods to safely access and modify the private data.\n","\n","#question-9.What is a constructor in Python?\n","- A constructor in Python is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes (data) when the object is created.\n","\n","#question-10.What are class and static methods in Python?\n","- Class Method (@classmethod): A method that takes cls (the class) as its first parameter. It can modify class-level attributes.\n","\n","- Static Method (@staticmethod): A method that doesn't take self or cls as its first parameter. It doesn’t modify instance or class attributes and is just a utility function related to the class.\n","\n","#question-11. What is method overloading in Python?\n","- In Python, if you define multiple methods with the same name, the last one defined will overwrite the previous ones.\n","\n","```python\n","class babu bhaiya :\n","    def raju (self, name):\n","        print(f\"Hello, {name}\")\n","\n","    # This method would overwrite the first one\n","    def raju (self, name, age):\n","        print(f\"Hello, {name}, you are {age} years old.\")\n","\n","```\n","\n","#question-12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n","- oop overidiing occurs when a new subclass has same function or name which is already mentioned in its parent class which allows python to overide the orginal function with the new function.\n","\n","#question-13.What is a property decorator in Python?\n","- The @property decorator is used to control access to class attributes — like adding logic when you get, set, or delete a value, but still using it like a normal variable.\n","\n","#question-14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n","\n","  1. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method in their own way.\n","\n","  2. It enables code reusability by using a single interface to handle multiple types of objects.\n","\n","  3. It supports method overriding and allows subclasses to define their own behavior for inherited methods.\n","\n","  4. Polymorphism improves flexibility and maintainability by making it easy to add new classes without modifying existing code.\n","  \n","#question-15.What is an abstract class in Python?\n","- it is like You can't access it directly, but it tells you what you need to access it through a child class.\n","\n","#question-16.What are the advantages of OOP?\n","- advantages of oop:-\n"," - 1. we can re use the same the code multiple times.\n"," - 2. it makes your code for short and clean.\n"," - 3. it keeps your inofrmation safe.\n"," - 4. in this we can use same name for different functions.\n"," - 5. it is easy to update.\n","\n","#question-17.What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n","-\n","1. **Class variable** is shared by all objects.\n","2. **Instance variable** is unique to each object.\n","3. **Class variable** is defined outside methods.\n","4. **Instance variable** is defined using `self` inside methods.\n","5. Changing a **class variable** affects all instances.\n","6. Changing an **instance variable** affects only that object.\n","\n","#question-18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n","- multiple inheritance in python means an child class can inheritate from more then one parent class.\n","\n","example-\n","```python\n","class papa :\n","  def love(self):\n","    print(\"i love you\")\n","\n","class mummy :\n","  def love(self):\n","    print(\"i love you\")\n","\n","class beta(papa,mummy):\n","  def lele(self)\n","   print(\"mai beta hu\")\n","\n","   ```\n","#question-19.Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python\n","- __str__: For humans. It's meant to give a nice, readable description of the object. When you use print(), Python uses __str__.\n","\n","- __repr__: For developers. It should give a technical, detailed string that could help to recreate the object or give extra info about it. It's what Python uses when you type an object in the interpreter or use repr().\n","\n","#question-20.What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n","- The super() function in Python is a way to call methods or access properties from a parent class (the class your class is inheriting from) in your child class.\n","\n","#question-21.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","- The purpose of __del__ is to allow an object to clean up any resources that has been holding onto before it is deleted by garbage cleaner.\n","\n","#question-22.What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n","- A @staticmethod is a method that doesn’t need access to the instance (self) or the class (cls). It behaves like a regular function that is bound to the class, but it doesn’t have access to instance-specific or class-specific data.\n","\n","- A @classmethod is a method that takes the class itself (cls) as the first argument, not the instance. This allows the method to modify class-level properties or to access class-level methods. It is bound to the class rather than an instance.\n","\n","#question-23.How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n","- Polymorphism allows different classes to have the same method name, but each class can implement the method differently. This means you can call the same method on objects of different classes, and each class will respond in its own way.\n","\n","- How It Works with Inheritance:\n","it ensures that when we call the child classes it gives the correct child class out of all child class with same name.\n","\n","example\n","\n","```python\n","\n","class animal:\n","  def speak (self):\n","    print(\"baba bangali\")\n","\n","class dog(animal):\n","  def speak (self):\n","    print(\"baba bangali tu\")\n","\n","class cat(animal):\n","  def speak (self):\n","    print(\"baba tu bangali\")\n","\n","animals = [Dog(), Cat()]\n","\n","for animal in animals:\n","    animal.speak()\n","```\n","\n","#question-24.What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n","- Method chaining is a technique in object-oriented programming where multiple methods are called on the same object, one after the other, in a single line of code.\n","\n","#question-25.What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n","- the __call__ method in Python is a special method that allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. This means that you can use an object of a class as if it were a function, and it will trigger the __call__ method.\n","\n","```python\n","class baba:\n","    def __call__(self, name):\n","        return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n","greeter = baba()\n","result = greeter(\"John\")\n","print(result)\n","```\n","\n","\n","\n","  "],"metadata":{"id":"Ww68tLvqFks1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Practical Questions\n","#question-1.Create a parent class Animal with a method speak() that prints a generic message.
